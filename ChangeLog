2019/05/08 - 1.0:
- TWAIN: Add support for frame options (tl-x, tl-y, br-x, br-y)
- Sane: Fix: 'net' backend: when we get SANE_INFO_RELOAD_OPTIONS, we must call
  we must first call sane_get_option_descriptor() before sane_control_option()
  even if we just want to use sane_control_option() to get the number of
  options.
- normalizer 'min_one_source': do not use the type of the root item on the
  child, it's not a good value and prevents 'one_page_flatbed' from working
  correctly.

  Andrade)
